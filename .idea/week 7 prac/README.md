# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains practical work and assignments for the CP1404 course, focusing on clean and efficient programming practices.

## About the Author

I'm [Logeshwaran], a student at [JCU] studying [BACHELOR OF CYBERSECURITY]. I'm passionate about programming and always looking to improve my skills.

## Clean Code Lessons

Throughout this course, I've learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

1. **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand, using meaningful variable and function names, proper indentation, and comments to explain complex logic.
2. **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions or classes to make the code easier to maintain and debug.
3. **Efficiency**: Optimize code to run faster and consume less memory by using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
