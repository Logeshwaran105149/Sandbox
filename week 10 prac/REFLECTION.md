# Reflections on Practical Tasks

## Estimations of Practical Tasks

In the beginning, the estimation of time required for practical tasks was a bit challenging. My initial estimates were often too optimistic, and I found that tasks often took longer than expected. However, as the subject progressed and I became more familiar with the workflow and the type of challenges involved, my accuracy improved significantly. This was an important lesson in the value of experience when it comes to project estimation.

## Code Reviews

Being both the reviewer and the reviewee in code reviews has been a highly enlightening experience. As the reviewer, I've learnt to appreciate the variety of approaches that can be used to solve a problem. It has also sharpened my eye for identifying potential issues and improvements. Being reviewed, on the other hand, has taught me to accept constructive criticism and use it to improve my own code. It's also shown me the importance of writing clear, understandable code for my peers.

## Practical Tasks Overall

If I were in charge of the subject, I would encourage even more pair programming. I found this to be an extremely valuable learning tool, as it allows for real-time feedback and learning from each other. Additionally, I would introduce more real-world examples to make the practical tasks more relatable.
